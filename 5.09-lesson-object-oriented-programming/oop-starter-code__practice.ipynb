    "\n",
    "There are several **programming paradigms** (ie, programming patterns/styles) out there. Most languages fall into multiple of them, but many language choose to specialize in one of them. In modern programming, two paradigms seem to dominate:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional Programming\n",
    "The FP paradigm involves completing all of your tasks via making **functions** and using them in a very clever manner. This sounds simple, but it is not. A hallmark of FP is frequent use of functions similar to `map` and `apply`, as well as anonymous functions (`lambda`s).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of some common languages that specialize in FP:**\n",
    "* R\n",
    "* Scala\n",
    "* Haskell\n",
    "* The Lisp family (Clojure, Lisp, Scheme, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pros of FP | Cons of FP |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| Code is easy to read | Code is hard to write |\n",
    "| Code tends to be much shorter | Steep learning curve |\n",
    "| It has very strong foundations in theoretical math | It has very strong foundations in theoretical math |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "The OOP paradigm involves **creating your own data types**. These data types can **maintain their own state** and **have their own methods and functions assocated with them**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of some common languages that specialize in OOP:**\n",
    "* Python\n",
    "* Ruby\n",

    "| --- | --- |\n",

    "\n",
    "## Python is Object-Oriented!\n",
    "![](imgs/gvr.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "While Python _does_ support a lot of FP tools, Python is designed to work best with an OOP design. In fact, even the parts of Python that are designed to allow you to work in FP are built on top of OOP. (In most languages, it's the other way around!)"

    "You're actually very familiar with **using** OOP tools. Objects like `DataFrame`, `StandardScaler`, and `LinearRegression` have all followed the traditional OOP pattern. If you understand how to manipulate those objects, you know OOP!\n",

    "### When would we needs this?\n",
    "Luckily for us, between `pandas` and `sklearn`, most of the classes we need have already been built for us. But data scientists don't work in a vacuum! Here are some examples of times where building your own class is the right thing to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Whenever you want to bundle your code into a package.\n",
    "It's true that you can define functions that can be `import`ed, but it's not very _Pythonic_. True Pythonistas will build related tools into classes that can be shared amongst coworkers. **If you set this up properly, you can even have them be `pip install`able from either a private or prublic Git repository!** Think about all of the different libraries we've used so far. You know this pattern to be true!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Whenever you want to \"build once, run many times later.\"\n",
    "Imagine a complicated task, such as connecting to a server and executing code on it. These tasks typically have a lot of rote boilerplate code that you'd want to automate. For example, check out this fantasy code you might write for connecting to a SQL server:\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Unit testing** is a type of automated testing you can do to ensure that minor changes you make to your code don't fundamentally change what your code is doing.\n",
