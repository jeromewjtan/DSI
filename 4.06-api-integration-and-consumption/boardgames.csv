**Original Post**

I've been to my fair share of cons, but last weekend was my first time seeing them from the other side of the bar. I had a blast, met some awesome people and got my ass kicked at Star Realms. It was a truly awesome experience.

However, I was honestly shocked at the way some people spoke to my fellow demonstrators and wanted to bring this up here and perhaps clear up a few things.

First off, here is an actual interaction I had with an attendee.

It was the busiest day of the convention and our game had already booked up all of its demo slots by mid-morning. Unfortunately, that meant I had to disappoint a lot of people, most of whom were really cool about it and many of whom remarked on how awesome it was that we were so popular. It was at this point that an American Lady approached us.

Me = Me / AL = American Lady

AL: ""Hi, I'd like to book a slot for your game""

Me: ""I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid we're fully booked up for the whole day, but...""

AL: ""Can I book one for tomorrow then?""

Me: ""Once again, really sorry, but we're only taking on-the-day bookings to give single day ticket holders a fair chance at getting a game. If you come back early tomorrow, I can book you in.""

AL: ""So I'm not special enough to book for tomorrow then?""

Me: ""Nobody is. The only fair way to go about this is to treat everybody equally, but if you...""

AL: ""I see how it is"" *proceeds to storm away in a tantrum*

I wish this was an isolated incident, but it was by no means the only time I saw this kind of interaction.

I realise most of you already know this and I'm effectively preaching to the choir, but the demo guys at conventions are almost all volunteers, giving up their whole weekend to add a little bit of variety to your con. You don't need to thank them, after all, they want to be there, but at least be nice to them.

This kind of behaviour is not cool when visited upon actual paid employees, but it's really quite indefensible to speak to a volunteer like that. I'd hate to think that some bright-eyed, young, first-time demonstrator might be put off of ever volunteering again because some mean attendee made them feel like crap.

I get it. It's humid, stuffy, noisy in the hall. You've just had to re-mortgage your apartment to afford an overpriced cheeseburger and a cup of stale coffee, and now that game you really wanted to try out is denied you, despite you paying a fair bit of cash for a ticket to attend, but it isn't anyone's fault.

It certainly isn't the fault of the happy, smiling nerd who would have informed you that the whole team had volunteered to run games in a local bar all evening for those who were disappointed, had you only let him finish any of his sentences.

In the words of Bill S. Preston, ""be excellent to each other"".","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit: So it has become quite apparent that I need to clarify a few things:&lt;/p&gt;

**Mistakes**

&amp;#x200B;

**Games we've released back into the wild:**

* Quoridor - Gorgeous &amp; Brilliant, but too chesslike. Abstract Strategy seems to collect dust)
* Santorini - Beautiful components, great mechanics, didn't know we HATE Abstract Strategy)
* Stratego: 50 Years - A childhood game I adored, but... Abstract Strategy. Are you seeing a pattern?)
* Ticket To Ride: New York - Not enough choices to make. Great for kids.
* Lost Cities - Too Simple. Felt like a waste of time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Games we'll be selling from our collection:**

* Age of War (2014) - Way too much luck! Made a home made expansion to make it more fun.
* Carcassonne (2000) - Great for it's time, like the Beatles.
* Eight-Minute Empire (2012) - Fantastic for what it is, but a little too ""travel-game"" for us.
* Flip Ships (2017) - We prefer Strategy to Dexterity, but still an Awesome Game!
* Game of Thrones: Hand of the King (2016) - Abstract Strategy. when will I learn?
* Jamaica (2007) - It's a wonderful family game, just not what we were looking for.
* NMBR 9 (2014) - Too simple for us.
* Rising 5: Runes of Asteros (2017) - Beautiful Dutrait Art, and cool mechanics, but low replay-ability.

**Realizations**

&amp;#x200B;

**Find what YOU Like/Dislike:** All the reviews in the world won't give you 100% a purchase success rate. You don't know what you like and don't like until you play it. Part of the learning curve of Board Gaming is making purchase mistakes and learning from them. I didn't even know what Abstract Strategy was, until one day I thought ""Hey, all these games I dislike are kind of chesslike..."" or that I seemed to love a certain amount of options, or that I seem to care about the component's art more than most, or that I love multiplayer solitaire with just a little ""take that"".

&amp;#x200B;

**Don't RELY on Reviews:** BGG and Reviewers might point you in the right direction, but ultimately, if you want to know if you will like a game, watch it being played, or play it yourself. Hearing an overview of it's mechanics aren't enough to know if you will find them satisfying.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pace yourself:** If you're anything like me, you want to buy way more than you can play. A lot of us are collectors by nature, and that can really hurt finances and even make you resent the hobby. I made a couple of rules to keep my collector-nature at bay and to motivate me to pay more. I realize that **these rules aren't for everyone**, but they are perfect for us.

In order to buy a new game:

1. **No Shelf of Shame:** Each game in your collection should have been played at least 1 time.
2. **10 Plays:** At least 10 plays of any games between each purchase.
3. **25 Max:** 25 Games Max in your collection. (If you want something new, sell something you aren't playing.)

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to take a moment to share our collection and ramblings, and thank you all for being part of a friendly and informative community that elevates this hobby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context: We are &lt;strong&gt;2 tired parents&lt;/strong&gt; that love to game at the end of the day. We keep our gaming relatively light and short. We love Eurogames, and dislike co-op and abstract.&lt;/p&gt;

Just the skull tokens are pictured. What would be the rose tokens are just plain blank chips. 

Skull is one of my absolute favorite games to break out at the bar with my gaming group and as a way to bring non-gamers into our circle.

One evening we met some friends at one of the local breweries, and needless to say one of the players refused to treat the components with respect, and had rubbed the ever-loving crap out of it, scuffing it up (as seen in the album). So, Skull sat on the shelf for a while so I could ignore the fact that it was damaged. Another friend had a copy that was ruined by small children, and so I decided that I wanted to make an inexpensive and more durable solution for us.

I ordered an inexpensive set of Cardinal poker chips from Amazon (\~$8), borrowed a container of Mod Podge from a friend and printed some skull icons on my printer. I cut out the icons using a small Xacto knife and then just put a couple layers of mod podge on the top to protect them. From that cheap set of poker chips I was able to make 6 sets of Skull tokens with 5 different colors. All-in-all, less than $10 worth of materials and 1 hour of my time.

Best part? They're damn-near indestructible. Not only are they rub-proof, but spill-proof and their small size makes it super easy to put in the car and take with me. If I lose a piece I just replace it easily with another chip. I'd highly recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive alternative!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Album here (graphic imagery of ruined game components, fair warning!):  &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/Kqo2Nwt""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/Kqo2Nwt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just the skull tokens are pictured. What would be the rose tokens are just plain blank chips. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skull is one of my absolute favorite games to break out at the bar with my gaming group and as a way to bring non-gamers into our circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One evening we met some friends at one of the local breweries, and needless to say one of the players refused to treat the components with respect, and had rubbed the ever-loving crap out of it, scuffing it up (as seen in the album). So, Skull sat on the shelf for a while so I could ignore the fact that it was damaged. Another friend had a copy that was ruined by small children, and so I decided that I wanted to make an inexpensive and more durable solution for us.&lt;/p&gt;
