    "As a newcomer to Python you might not realize how important it is to manage your project dependencies and how they might impact running your code in a production environment for other people to use.  The primary problem a `virtualenv` solves, is library depencies through environment isolation.\n",

    "- Projects can use different versions of Python\n",
    "- Projects can use different versions of Python libraries\n",
    "- You don't have to worry about how differnet Python requirements may affect the operability of your Python application\n",
    "\n",
    "`virtualenv` constructs isolated environments for your python application(s) and enables you to use a set of environment configuration and assumptions, such as different python libraries in an isolated environment, instead of globally (ie: using a single environment to manage all of your Python applications like the default environment on your laptop).\n",
    "\n",
    "`virtualenv` works by copying the version of Python you want ot use, and an entire set of files that manage Python, into their own directory.  They are like conda environments that we already use in our DSI class.  You can easily switch between them, **activating** and **deactiving** them on-demmand.\n",
    "\n",
    "> _Despite the word \"virtual\" in `virtualenv` it is not a virtual machine like VMWare, or VirtualBox.  It's really just a way to **activate** and switch between a set of Python versions with associated libraries, from the command line._\n",

Virtualenv is an alternative to conda environments that help you work with isolated Python environments.  This is useful when you want to deploy an application into a production environment where it is available 24/7, with minimal operating libraries.  Would you want to make it a requirement to deploy all libraries we use in class to a production environment in order for an app with very simple features to run?  It can be complicated to manage Python library dependencies that may even work differently on OSX than say a Linux environment.
