    "## Practical Suggestions\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- In binary classification, start with a single output node with a sigmoid activation function.\n",
    "- For multi-class classification, have one output node for each class and use the softmax activation function.\n",
    "- For hidden layers, the ReLU and hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation functions often work well.  Start with the ReLU as your first trial.\n",
    "- Start with one hidden layer, then trying adding another if performance is not good.\n",
    "- For simplicity, start with the same number of units in each hidden layer, then increase this number for all hidden layers simultaneously if the performance is not good.\n",
    "- Alternatively, you can use the \"stretchy pants\" approach and through a lot of hidden nodes into your network, but then stop training as soon as you detect the onset of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "> These suggestions are largely adapted from the book _Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow_ by Aurelien Geron, a book I highly recommend!"
