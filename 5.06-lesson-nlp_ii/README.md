## Learning Objectives

*After this lesson, students will be able to:*
1. **Define** and **implement** `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfVectorizer`.
2. **Understand** some of the parameters that can be tuned in a `CountVectorizer`.
3. **Model** an NLP dataset using `CountVectorizer` and `LogisticRegression` in a `Pipeline`.
4. **Tune** the `Pipeline` using `GridSearchCV`
