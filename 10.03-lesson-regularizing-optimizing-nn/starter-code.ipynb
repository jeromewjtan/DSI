    "Today, we learned about three different methods of regularizing our neural networks: `L2` regularization, dropout, and early stopping.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Learning Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "As promised, managing bias and variance takes a lot of our attention. If our bias or variance are high, it's likely that our model isn't performing as well as it could.\n",
    "\n",
    "A workflow for how you should address this (in the context of neural networks and beyond) is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do we have high bias? (i.e. are we performing poorly on our training set?)\n",
    "    - If so:\n",
    "        - let's build a more complex model / bigger network!\n",
    "        - let's consider a new architecture for our neural network!\n",
    "        - let's train longer!\n",
    "- Do we have high variance? (i.e. are we performing poorly on our test/holdout set?)\n",
    "    - If so:\n",
    "        - let's gather more data!\n",
    "            - Usually very difficult, but we should use \"data augmentation\" if we can!\n",
    "        - let's build a simpler model / smaller network!\n",
    "        - let's consider a new architecture for our neural network!\n",
    "        - let's regularize!\n",
    "    - Once we're satisfied, return to the bias question and repeat.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Note:** Before deep learning, most tools for handling high bias or high variance adversely affected the other. However, depending on the amount of data we have and how complex our network is, it's often the case that we can drastically reduce variance with out affecting bias.\n",
