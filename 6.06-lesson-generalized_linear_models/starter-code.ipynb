    "Chosing the right kind of generalized linear model (GLM) from all possibilities really boils down to picking the \"error.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"error\" model is really telling you how you expect observations to be distributed.  It is a probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. In traditional linear regression, the error term is a normal distribution.  This means that you expect actual observations to be normally distributed around your line.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 2. In logistic regression, the error term is a Bernoulli distribution.  This means that you expect actual observations to be above (1) or below (0) the logit curve with a certain probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the distribution function often points to a link function you should use: [here is a table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model#Link_function).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If $Y$ is a non-negative integer:\n",
    "   - Poisson regression if mean $\\approx$ variance\n",
    "   - Negative Binomial regression if variance $\\gg$ mean (overdisperse)\n",
    "   - For example,\n",
    "     - Units sold\n",
    "     - Customers through the door\n",
    "     - Patients to the ER\n",
    "     - Number of cars racing the red light\n",
    "2. If $Y$ values represent categories\n",
    "   - Multinomial logistic regression (unordered categories)\n",
    "   - Ordinal logstic regression (ordered categories)\n",
    "   - For example,\n",
    "     - Does a population tend to buy groceries at Whole Foods, Publix or Kroger?\n",
    "     - Will millenials vote democrat, republican or independent?\n",
    "     - Predicting the Amazon star rating of books.\n",
