# Supervised learning flavors
What are the two types of supervised learning, and how are they different? (thread)

# Clustering examples
What kinds of real-world problems might be able to be solved with clustering? (thread)

# How many k?

/poll "How many k: Figure 2" "1" "2" "3" "4" anonymous
/poll "How many k: Figure 3" "1" "2" "3" "4" anonymous

# How many k in example?
How many clusters do we have now? (emoji react)

# Show me the mean values for `x1` and `x2` within each cluster for our data

# Why can't we increase k just to get a better inertia?
